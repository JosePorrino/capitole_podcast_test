### Main View - Requirements:

- Display a list of the top 100 podcasts according to Apple's listing (more info at the end of the document).
- Once the list is retrieved from the external service for the first time, store it locally so that it's only requested again if more than a day has passed since the last request.
- Allow users to filter the displayed podcasts by entering a text string that considers both the podcast titles and the names of their authors.
- Immediate filtering that reacts as the user types the filtering text.
- Clicking on a podcast should navigate the user to the detailed view of that podcast.

### Header - Requirements:

- The application title should act as a link to the main view of the application.
- Whenever a client-side navigation is initiated, display a visual indicator in the top right corner of the page to reflect that the process is underway. The indicator should disappear after the transition to the new view is complete.

### Podcast Detail View - Requirements:

- Display a sidebar with the podcast's image, title, author, and description.
- Show a main section that displays the number of episodes the podcast currently has, along with a list of episodes indicating their title, publication date, and duration.
- Once the detail of a podcast is retrieved from the external service for the first time, store it locally so that it's only requested again if a day has passed since the last request.
- Clicking on an episode title should navigate the user to the detailed view of that episode.

### Episode Detail View - Requirements:

- Display the same sidebar as in the previous view.
- Both the podcast image and title, as well as the author's name, should be links to the podcast's detail view (these components can also have the same links in the previous view).
- Show a main section that displays the podcast's title, description, and a basic audio player (native HTML5) for playing the podcast.
- Take into consideration that some episode descriptions contain HTML, and this should be interpreted (not escaped) when displayed.
